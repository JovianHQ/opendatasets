# opendatasets

`opendatasets` is a Python library for downloading datasets from online sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and Google Drive using a simple Python command.

### Installation

Install the library using `pip`:

```
pip install opendatasets --upgrade
```

### Usage - Downloading a dataset

Datasets can be downloaded within a Jupyter notebook or Python script using the `opendatasets.download` helper function. Here's some sample code for downloading the [US Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset):

```
import opendatasets as od
dataset_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset'
od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset')
```

`dataset_url` can also point to a public Google Drive link or a raw file URL.

### Kaggle Credentials

`opendatasets` uses the [Kaggle Official API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) for donwloading dataset from Kaggle. Follow these steps to find your API credentials:

1. Go to [https://kaggle.com/me/account](https://kaggle.com/me/account) (sign in if required).

2. Scroll down to the "API" section and click "Create New API Token". This will download a file `kaggle.json` with the following contents:

```
{"username":"YOUR_KAGGLE_USERNAME","key":"YOUR_KAGGLE_KEY"}
```

3. When you run `opendatsets.download`, you will be asked to enter your username & Kaggle API, which you can get from the file downloaded in step 2.

Note that you need to download the `kaggle.json` file only once. You can also place the `kaggle.json` file in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook, and the credentials will be read automatically.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you're downloading a competition dataset, make sure to first accept the rules of the competition.

`opendatasets` also provides some curated datsets that you can download by passing the Dataset ID to `opendatasets.download`. Here's an example:

```
import opendatasets
opendatasets.download('stackoverflow-developer-survey-2020')
```

The following datasets are available for download.
